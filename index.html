              <p>My name is Sanushka Das (but you can call me Shan if that is too hard!). I am a first year studying a Bachelor of Infromation Technology. I am Indian however I was born in Oman and came to Australia when I was 4. When I first came here I was speaking a mix of three languages Hindi, Malayalam and English, which inevitably made it difficult to communicate with my peers at school. Quickly over time my English improved, however I became less fluent in other languages. Nowadays I am trying to relearn all those languages as it is always beneficial. I just graduated highschool in 2020, which I think we can all agree was an interesting year. In my spare time I enjoy experimenting with different forms of art, as it is a calming expression of my thoughts and emotions. The most recent art form I have been trying is digital art!
