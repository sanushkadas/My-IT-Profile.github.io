          <p>This job ad is looking for a cyber security consultant. A cyber security consultant works with clients who want to ensure their safety against possible cyber attacks. Cyber security consultants can either work for a company or work for individual clients. A cybersecurity consultant will form a report for the client once any issues have been identified and fixed. The most appealing aspects of this job is definitely the ability to ethically hack into systems for a client which seems super interesting to me. I also really like how in this job you can pretty much do it from anywhere you want. You can do it at home remotely or you can work in an office and you can also travel to different countries while continuing with your job.
</p>
<p>The necessary skills and qualifications required for this job would be a bachelor degree in either computer science or information technology and a major in cyber security. Before becoming a consultant you would need relevant work experience, working in the IT field for three to five years would definitely set you up with the relevant skills to become a cyber security consultant. Some employers may also look for work experience in consulting. Personal attributes needed in this job would need to be strong communicator with being able to translate complex IT/ security terminology to clients with little to no IT background</p>
<p>At the moment I have only started my bachelor degree with very little work experience. I have strong communication skills although my IT knowledge is limited. Throughout my bachelor degree I could definitely enhance the personal attributes needed for this job by learning to explain the content I learn to people with no IT background. I would need to successfully complete my bachelor degree in IT and then do my masters in Cyber security. Having a masters in cyber security would definitely help when trying to go higher up in the cyber security field. After completing my masters I would try to get an entry level job in the IT/Security field and slowly work my way up to positions like analyst or an administrator once I have gained the necessary security experience I can apply to be a cyber security consultant.
