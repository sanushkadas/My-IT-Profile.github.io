The results of my Myers-Briggs test show that my personality type belongs to the group "INFJ-T".The results show that I have a balance between being extraverted and introverted, which suggests that I can be comfortable working in a busy office environment or working remotely with a client. The weaknesses of my personality suggest that I may be sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up and a perfectionist. Being a perfectionist in a team setting could be both beneficial and also a negative as I could be paying attention to detail but I may be overbearing on others. Most of my decisions seem to be intuitive and feeling based rather than focusing on the situation or based on pure logic.

<p>The results of what type of learning style I have indicates that I am definitely a visual learner. This means that when planning for projects I would need a very visual plan so that I fully understand what I am creating. Even when completing the project visual features may be of more value to me compared to auditory or tactile features. This also is helpful to know when I am trying to revise or study for assignments so I know what type of learning method would be most effective.

<p>
  The results of what my workplace personality indicates that I am a guardian which means I am very detailed orientated and I like to carefully take actions in projects. However, I donâ€™t like unexpected events which may be a problem when some errors may occur during the development stage in projects. Certain aspects of my workpalce personality would be very helpful when coding and programming as attention to detail is very important to avoid potential errors.
  </p>

<p> When working in a team I imagine my personality to be easy to be quite detail orientated and a perfectionist which may or may not be beneficial to the team. When forming a team I would want someone who counters my personality so that I can see things from a different perspective which would only enhance the group's success. Someone who are not too bothered when unexpected issues come up. Someone who makes decisions by looking more at the situation and with logic. I would need people who will speak out when they see an issue in my idea but is still considerate of my sensitivity to criticism.</p>
